# 💫 About Me

Full-Stack Developer with production experience building web applications using React, Next.js, and FastAPI.  
I focus on writing clean, maintainable TypeScript and building performance-optimized frontend architectures.  
Experienced in designing REST APIs, implementing RBAC systems, and working with PostgreSQL databases.  
Comfortable handling the full deployment lifecycle — from development to domain mapping and hosting.  
Worked in a startup environment delivering features under strict sprint deadlines.  
Always improving my system design thinking and backend architecture skills.
